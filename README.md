## Problem Statement
    
 - We come from an only women's college and feel that there was a lot that we faced to come where we are today.
                                          
 - Looking around and taking surveys we realized that indeed, the entire women community faces a common set of challenges which include not having communities of like minded people, abstaining from talking on taboo topics, scaling small businesses and access to right resources. 
                                          
 - Additionally, there is no one stop solution for us women. Thereby, we came up with the idea of SHAKTI, an app for women of all age groups, from those young girls to us to all the mothers out there!

## Implementation of Agile Methodology

### What is Agile?
Agile is a development methodology adopted today in the software industry. Agile promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and sle-organizing teams.

### How I incorporated Agile Methodology during the development cycle?
SCRUM is a subset of Agile, a framework for developing software.The basic time working unit is the sprint. SCRUM teams always reason in sprints and their planning is limited to sprints.

- Sprint 1: **Research and Design** : Researching about ways to accomplish face recognition and dogs. Finding ways to query documents from firebase based on location. Exploring more about firestore and firebase storage. Designing the app theme and layout and wireframing the overall appearance, Planning out how the different functionalities would be embedded on different screens and the order in which they would be implemented.

- Sprint 2: **Building the application** : Divided the app into two interfaces: owner and finder. Built and coded the core of the application including all the functionalities separately for both the interfaces.Ensured data consistency in the database. Encountered bugs which were either fixed by reading through stack overflow and documentations or alternative implementations were found for the same. The UI was taken care of throughout the process so that the user experience is not compromised during the implementation of the functionalities. Later, when both the interfaces were complete the navigation routes were set up so as to link the interfaces properly.

- Sprint 3: **Testing and debugging** : Tested the app and fixed all the bugs. Tested it from user point of view and implemented minor additional features that could improve the experience. This also included the implementation of alert boxes, loading screens and snackbars.

## Special Instructions to Work with the App

## Challenges Faced
1. The major challenge was recognizing and matching the faces of women only. Though, there are a lot a APIs that support human face recognition, none of them clearly mentions about gender face recognition.
   - *Therefore, I decided to implement tflite models inorder to predict the women.*
